# Project-16 Rode Home Page Clone
This is simple website of home page. In this project I have only used tailwind css. It is responsive as well.









## Benifits of making this project.


 - Learned to make responsive we need alot of testing for all screen. Hence making responsive is same as writing css . Here we used  Tailwind css  in different screen.
 - Also learned concept of flexbox, flexbox ratios grid property.
